# vaulisp

Experimenting with a Clojure-based fexpr-centric lisp

## Installation

git clone

## Usage

### Start a vaulisp REPL:

    clj -M -m egg.vaulisp

or for a REPL which also starts an [nREPL server](https://nrepl.org/nrepl/0.8/usage/server.html#using-clojure-cli-tools):

    ./vau

Coming later: run a vaulisp file or open a repl in the context of such a file.

Basic functions gradually being added. See `egg.vaulisp/global-env` for the set
of currently-implemented functions. Note that some "functions" are actually
[operatives](https://fexpr.blogspot.com/2011/04/fexpr.html) (Paul Shutt's
terminology), which behave more like macros executed at runtime, in that their
arguments are only evaluated if that's done explicitly in the body of the
operative. As a result, there are almost no special forms, quoting is entirely
irrelevant, and language users can easily define operatives like `if` which only
evaluate one of their two possible branches.
